	May 8th, 2019

	This folder contains the Project and all of its cpp, header,
	libraries and the PowerPoint. 
	
	You should be able to run the program with out needing to add the
	paths to the libraries and additional directories as long as you
	click on the project file. However, I am not completely sure of 
	this.
